Calculation Definitions
Key Metrics
Per-Capita Rate:
Parcels Per 1000 Population = (Total Parcels / Population in 1000s)
Normalizes demand by area size for fair comparison
Year-over-Year Growth:
YoY Growth % = ((Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year) × 100
Measures demand change vs same period last year
Seasonal Index:
Winter months = December, January, February
Seasonal spike = (Winter Average - Annual Average) / Annual Average
Quantifies winter demand increase
